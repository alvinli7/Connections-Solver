NYT Connections Solver (CLI)

Have you ever struggled with the NYT connections game? If you have, so have I. Instead of closing the tab and "giving up," I created a tool that could assist me in solving this daily puzzle. This is a command-line tool that groups 16 words into four related groups using semantic similarity and combinatorial search.

Run:
python main.py
